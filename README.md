NB : This project has been made in a total of ~10 15h by a complete beginner in angular that wanted to try this famous framework, hope you enjoy using it !

NB2 : As we talked together, I did again your homework, but this time using Vue3,  with approximatively the same amount of time.
I did not focus on style, but instead on features as guards, internationalization(i18n) using last & most popular tools from vue ecosystem such as vuetify, vite, pinia, etc.
For the backend, I chose to store purchases data in a .json, instead of having a huge backend. For this kind of project seems overkill to me, but if I had too, I would have use MongoDB/Mongoose.
Give it a try!
